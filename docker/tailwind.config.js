    /* Surface contract, and it inverts the daisyUI convention on purpose --
       in BOTH themes:

         base-100  raised surface   cards, popovers, modals, header, sidebar
         base-200  page ground      <body>
         base-300  border / hover

       Reading it the other way round is what made a card in the light theme
       darker than the page it sat on. The dark theme always worked this way;
       only the light one was inverted. Everything daisyUI paints base-100 by
       itself -- modal-box, inputs -- is a raised surface too, so the two agree.

       One meaning per accent role, so a colour is never decoration:

         primary    filled action        the one solid button on a page
         secondary  navigation, links, focus
         accent     update available
         info/success/warning/error   state, and nothing else

       primary and secondary are both blue in the dark theme. They are told
       apart by form, not hue: filled is an action, tinted is navigation. A
       filled active nav row would collapse the distinction. */
